# What are we developing?
We the team Sigma Coders have conceptualized an idea of developing an application though which we could allow our users to schedule their **sports events/tournaments/virtual game tournaments** and even they can find match pair for any particular sports in their **college,schools and societies** as well.

# What do we achieve using this app?
Our app provides ease to our clients for pairing and finding tournaments or ongoing events that our happening around your area. **Our clients can participate in the ongoing events or even host an event!!**

A perfect application for finding new people around you with similar interest near you.

You can find,schedule,chat,host and what not...

**This is just thematic overview of our idea and not the entire version of it..**

**We have a lot more up our sleeves!!**
