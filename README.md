**In societies and arenas one can easily schedule a tournaments,find sponsors and also make it easily eventful by calling people in.**  

Currently **sports is a vital part of person's day to day schedule** and it is a boost up app and can urge people to schedule and enjoy any events without having any problems to it.

**Why do we join a sports club?** we join it because we can find people to play a sport and play in their courts right? So what if when this app becomes scalable, we can implement for people to tip in money for a particular sport and enjoy it!
